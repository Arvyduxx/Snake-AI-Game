# Snake-AI-Game
An ideal Snake Game created by an AI.

Hey guys, thanks for playing my game. This game is created by AI (I don't know how to code, but I'm willing to learn soon).
So this is a kinda more advanced, simple Snake game that has a couple of Modes like Classic mode, Unlimited Mode, Hard mode (if you want to know more about modes, read Snake Ai Game version 1.0 description)
The code is open source, so you can use it in your projects, but if you use it, please tag me; it would be nice.

Rules of using software:
1. As I mentioned, this software is open source, so no third-party people cant sell or distribute this software without my permission.
2. This software can be used for projects, so you can freely change the softwares code, but marking the software as your own and selling it is prohibited.
3. Ignorance of the rules does not exempt from legal responsibility.

Thanks for reading.
